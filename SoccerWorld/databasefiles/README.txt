Please follow these steps to set up the database:

1) Please take a moment to go over the PDF in this folder called "Webapplication_userguide.pdf". It goes over everything, including creating a database in your MyWeb site and a database username/password.

2) Once you have your database created, go to the folder:
:/SoccerWorld/phpmethods/db-connect.php 
This is where you will update all the new connection information

3) Enter your MyWeb, and go to the phpMyAdmin. If you followed the pdf then this should be all set

4) In phpMyAdmin, click on the main database folder from the left (top of the tree). In the middle of the window, you will see a horizontal menu starting with "Structure" -> Click on Import

5) Browse (or drag and drop) the two .sql files in this folder here, and the database will create and populate itself with the information that I had here
